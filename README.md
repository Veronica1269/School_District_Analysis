# School District Analysis



# Overview

Thomas High School ninth-graders' reading and math grades appear to have been altered in the students_complete.csv file according to the school board. Even though the school board is unaware of the entire scope of the cheating, they are looking for assistance in upholding state testing requirements. 

In this project, Thomas High School's math and reading test scores would be replaced with NaN values while keeping the rest of the data intact. The school board wants to repeat the school district analysis conducted previously and receive a report about how these adjustments influenced the overall study once the reading and math scores have been replaced.
